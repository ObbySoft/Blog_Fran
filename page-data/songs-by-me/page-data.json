Musically it is a simple song but it already carries\nsome of the things I like call \"my own\" which is a very bold statement on it self.\n\nThere's a huge jump in quality over 2017, all the songs that have title and lyrics are only missing marketing and a more experienced\nproductor to be released as proper songs in a proper EP. In here I started noticing my serious lack of producing experience but also\nmy lack of musical ability to deliver good takes in short time (now a days I just gave up and I do 30 takes and them comp them out, which\nseems to work although it is a serious amount of work). \"Tan Raro\" is a clear example of that, I love that song but I couldn't get it to\nsound like a killer hit, although I believe it does have the potential to be one. I might even produce it again sometime.\nAt this time I also started to play with harmonized voices and auto-tune which I went completely overboard with in \"Mas Fuerte\", although I really\nlike the final product.\n\nOn 2021 I just vomitted \"La Puerta del Infierno\" in like a session or two, notice how much time I spent not doing music, but music seemed\nto find a way and I just wrote that song in a heartbit, with riffs, choruses, lyrics, everything, the rest of time I just spent ironing it out and\nmaking sure that the production value was as top notch as I can provide (hey producing is though!).\n\n\nAs I write this summary I am producing and composing \"Amatista\", a slow melancholic abstract song in 6/8 (or 3/4), which is something I wanted to make for a long time,\nI am also finishing the production of \"El Can-Peon\". Yes, it is a song I composed on 2009 but now I am producing it, although I did made a attempt at producing it in 2017.\nI alwaws struglled to translate that song from its original one guitar acustic version into a full blown rock band production but I've seem to cracked that at some point\nin 2017 and now I am just refining that original design.\n\n-->","fields":{"slug":"/songs-by-me/","readingTime":{"text":"5 min read"}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Songs By Me","date":"May 30, 2022","description":"","tags":["english"],"author":{"id":"franleplant","bio":"Tech Lead and Software developer with a degree in Engineering.
