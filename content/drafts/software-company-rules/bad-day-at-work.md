Today I had a bad day at work.

This past week I overdid myself, did overtime, did 110%, went from meeting
to meeting trying to hunt business requirements. Trying to figure
out what I need to do urgently. Because everything is urgent.
Everything is top priority. How can we priotize something if
everything is top priority. How can I concentrate and do
some serius programming, how can I deliver value to the customer
if the people who are suposed to tell me what the customer considers valuable
dont know what the customer wants or they don't know how express it or
they simply lack the the will to sit down and document it?.
They want it all done by yesterday,
scrum is just an excuse to provide poorly specified tasks
that you need to guestimate the effort required and that at the end
of the sprint if you could not complete the task you will
be held accountable and you will require to work the weekend to
complete the task. So much for the Openess value of scrum.
And it wasn't even under my control, I had to hunt different
teams with different top priorities and with even more
meetings that myself (because they actually need to go the office,
so imagine the effective time they have to simple sit down
and concentrate and do actual work), the Pull Requests were
opened for 3 days and nobody even cared to approve or provide
feedback, there isn't a process for that so each repo and each reviewer
does its own thing, some repositories are complete spaghetti chaotic code some
others are trying to keep the quality up while being reprimended for doing that,
the database changes were audited up to the final
semicolon in the sql statement, I basically waited the whole sprint.
But I also helped other people, answer questions, had meetings
filling in the blanks that oh so godly Product Owners didn't care to fill,
I dreamed with how to solve the technical problem at hand
but in the morning I could not find the time to actually implement it.

And when I don't deliver all fingers point to me, nobody is ready to say
"hey, I had some blame in here" or "hey, we overestimated the task", but
you are greeted with comments like "I expected more from you" or "why developers are not
delivering in time?" (the time that we guestimated to begin with,
with very little information and that we need to figure out as we went).
And latter in your performance reviews they will tell you that you don't
excel in your job because you are not 110% commited to the job and
you are not proactive enough. Why should I be this commited to a job
that at the end of the day doesn't care about me? it only pays my salary
because slavery is not an option in my current context, but if things
go wrong they will without a doubt blame me or my peers and if things
go enough wrong they will undoubtely fire however much people is needed
in order to satisfy the stakeholders; but wait, if things go super fine
guess who's going to get all the credit? guess who is going to win fat
bonus checks and will be closer to being a millionare? So it is a zero
sum game for me and it is all you can eat buffet for upper management.


They do not understand how software is made, they blame their own faults on
underlings (developers mostly), they take all the credit and when we try
to make them understand we become alienated because of being "too fighsty"
or "coming in too strong". How can any good code and product be done in
this way? How can any innovation be done in this 
toxic environment? How can any single developer be committed to a job
that treat us as disposable black boxes that have fuzzy and incomplete requirements
and a (an above the medium) salary as input and million dolar software as an output?
How can we take our time to properly analyze and design software and
the necessary infrastructure the product needs when the Product Owners dont
know the produc they want and we cannot justify making technical tasks because
they dont provide value to the final customer? Is the contractor building
your house loosing time building the foundations of your house? Is the foundation
not providing value? Will you hold it against them if it rains and they cannot
pour the concrete? Will you hold it against them if in the middle of the construction
you decide that your house is going to be two stories instead of the one?
Do you think you can build a house by sending a list of postit notes to an architect 
and their contractors? What will you tell them in the restrospective? That they are not delivering
value because they need to rethink and redo the foundations for your now two story
house? 

In the end it all boils down to people and processes.
Scrum, while it might be good in certain scenarios and when well applied, is just
another tool that management uses to avoid understanding what software development is,
what is required from Product owners, what are the roles that are needed in a proper
software development team and to shift all the liability to developers while taking
all the profits from their work.

And you can't even be to critical of middle management because they are put
in the same preasure as the rest of the team, their position is arguably worse
because they are required to whip underlyings while they are being whipped by
the upper management.


I just think that software development as an engineering (that I argue that at least is partially one) is
not really well understood and people with big ideas just 
abuse this fact to make up for insane working environments, and
scrum is at the center of it all. Instead of using a proper
traditional engineering workflow (requirements, analyzis, design, implementation, testing),
they use a glorified TO-DO list that only focus on creating candy instead of
on all the machinery there is behind make that candy, and what are processes behind
creating said machinery, but hey, we are agile, people before processes broh.

There is also a great disconnect in terms of hiring people.
People that did a couple of years in business school and dont even read the 
scrum book are managing and bossing around people that sometimes have double or tripple
the time in studing deep core sofware engineering knowledge. They usually read in the morning
or at night everyday, they keep updated in an ever chaning techincal landscape and 
these people are meant to be your underlyings?
They expect developers to be excelent techincally, independent, self driven, with great communicatons,
possitive, commited, open, balance priorities and take the right decisiones
thinking about the business outcome when most of the management has quite a short
list of attributes. Pushing underlyings to work faster, stronger, better doesn't make you
a better person, business man or manager, it just makes you a poor leader and
most likely it reduces your chances of success. They need to assemble a team,
understand the proper processes to build a software and given them space to build the product,
while being clear about what is actually the product, what we are trying to accomplish,
what are the different phases we want to product to evolve into, this will let developers
and architects know what is the infra and how and when we can build the different supporting
infrastructure for a product.
