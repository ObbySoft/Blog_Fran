## Introduction / Preface

Observables: observing ourselves.

Draw paralele between observables in programing
and the ability of humans to observe our emotions, thoughts,
reactions, instintive acts.

## Part 1: Neurosis, Overthinking and Panic Attacks! Oh my!

Different stages of the same process.

Neurosis, Overthinking, can become patological,
not able to sleep and how that can become more ingrained in your brain
and will prevent you from sleeping from resting.

And this relates to how develpers'workd, like when we have problems to
solve and there at lot of contratints, a lot of things to consider and sometimes
you start thinking in the background while you sleep brute forcing the decision
tree so that you can come up with the best solution all things consider.

The same applies to understanding topics, happens to students.

You wont be able to concetrate, to sleep, to rest and this
is associated with emotions such as fears, doubts, impostor syndrome
it can mutate into a panic attack.

Different people will associate different emptions to these strong thpughts,
I personally tend to go through the impostor syndrome, not believeing I am
capable of solving the problem and believing that everybody will find out what a
fake I am, but other people will associate different empotions that are entirely
relate to your history as a person.
