This is a list of all the songs I have written in my life, I don't think I'm missing any.
2022 has been a crazy productive year, I think I might have broken some sort of barrier, these 7
songs are by a long shot the best songs I've every written, they even exceeded my wildest dreams, they
are full of emotion, with complex melodies in complex scales and arrangements and there so much room for doing more!

I'm very proud of 2022 and of this list of songs!

I have recently identified that in the background of my life I have been pretty consistently a musian at heart,
a composer, a producer, an artist, which is pretty funny when I think of it since I haven't made any great efforts
to be that, I had taken very little clases during my 15 year career and I have taken the whole thing without much seriousness.

It is indeed funny how life has some messages to give if one is ready to listen to them.

This is a list of all the songs I have composed over the years,some of them are crap, some of them are lost and not in this list, some of them are incomplete but
some of them I really love and I see potential in myself.
So my plan is to start taking this whole "music" thing more seriously,
I am buying equipment, books and setting myself some time periodically to just sit down and do music whatever that might be.

Some songs early on had just a touch of madness and naivity and horniness and crazyness of my past self that really show how
much potential I have if I just believe in myself for a minute, so take a page out of your own book and move on!

"Lujuria Maldad" was probably the first time I was proud of my work, that song is pretty fun, it uses strange harmonics and
it even switches from 4/4 to 3/4 at the end.

"El can-peon" a word play with the word "Campeon" (champion) and "Can Peon" (dog pawn) is a song about a friend that just did too much
coke for its own sake and was "lost" by it, a tragedy rock about real life. Musically it is a simple song but it already carries
some of the things I like call "my own" which is a very bold statement on it self.

There's a huge jump in quality over 2017, all the songs that have title and lyrics are only missing marketing and a more experienced
productor to be released as proper songs in a proper EP. In here I started noticing my serious lack of producing experience but also
my lack of musical ability to deliver good takes in short time (now a days I just gave up and I do 30 takes and them comp them out, which
seems to work although it is a serious amount of work). "Tan Raro" is a clear example of that, I love that song but I couldn't get it to
sound like a killer hit, although I believe it does have the potential to be one. I might even produce it again sometime.
At this time I also started to play with harmonized voices and auto-tune which I went completely overboard with in "Mas Fuerte", although I really
like the final product.

On 2021 I just vomitted "La Puerta del Infierno" in like a session or two, notice how much time I spent not doing music, but music seemed
to find a way and I just wrote that song in a heartbit, with riffs, choruses, lyrics, everything, the rest of time I just spent ironing it out and
making sure that the production value was as top notch as I can provide (hey producing is though!).


As I write this summary I am producing and composing "Amatista", a slow melancholic abstract song in 6/8 (or 3/4), which is something I wanted to make for a long time,
I am also finishing the production of "El Can-Peon". Yes, it is a song I composed on 2009 but now I am producing it, although I did made a attempt at producing it in 2017.
I alwaws struglled to translate that song from its original one guitar acustic version into a full blown rock band production but I've seem to cracked that at some point
in 2017 and now I am just refining that original design.
