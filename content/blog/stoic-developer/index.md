Stress, anxiety, panic attacks, impostor syndrome,
obsession, sleeplessness, dreaming about code, are among
the mental conditions we, developers, are exposed to because,
to put it simply, we **developers are professional thinkers**,
we are weight lifters of the mind,
but when you push your symbolic mind hard enough it can come
back to you in overdrive mode and attack you like a
hammer hitting your hand instead of the nail, or even
like a chainsaw chopping a finger instead of a branch.

Coping with these mental issues is hard but important to have
a healthy mind, life and to be an effective, efficient and holistic developer
and I believe that the Stoic teachings are valuable tools to manage
our emotions and behaviours and they provide a useful framework
to tackle any situation in our life.

Let this serve as a high-level introduction to Stoicism
and a good start towards a better life.

## What is Stoicism?

[Stoicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism)
is a philosophical movement that aims to help people manage and
even reduce pain in their life by recognising, at a high level, that
life is just a series of events and that we are the one that
classify them as **good** or **bad** and that the only real control we have is in
how we classify or interpret those events, and how willing we are
to accept the outcomes.

Stoicism trains the mind to be more resilient to pain by understanding
that it is unreasonable to get sad or anxious because of things
we don't have control over,
we can only do our best, hope for the best and react as best as we can
to whatever outcome life has in place.

As you can see these are powerful teachings and have I found them very useful
in my life, even when things turn dark.

Stoicism aims to achieve **strength of character**, endurance and resiliency
in the face of hardship by separating what is in our control from
what's not.

Of course Stoicism doesn't negate free will nor the things
we humans can achieve by affecting life around us, but instead,
it talks about reducing suffering in the outcomes by accepting that,
although we do have control over small aspects of life, we are largely
subject to the randomness of the universe but that we do have a strong
control over how our hearts and minds react to the outcomes.

Stoicism doesn't also go against pursue of success or riches, it just
states that we shouldn't feel attached to them so that we don't become
prisoners of the outcomes of those pursues, because if you are successful
and you feel attached to your success then you become a prisoner of your success
and you will live in fear of loosing it, same goes for money, recognition or whatever.
And if you couldn't get it in the first place you will also feel bad.
With this, rather common, mindset, we become prisoners of randomness.
Stoicism seeks to take control, become free, and ultimately live
a more peaceful life without so much suffering.

These teachings become even more important in the 21st century, where
we are in constant stress, anxiety and fear even for the smallest
things, like no getting the new phone, not getting enough likes,
not having the latest clothes,
or of not being able to go the pub on weekends.

Stoicism at last seeks deep thought about the nature of reality
and how can we interact with it in a peaceful and relaxed way,
by doing what we can and accepting the outcomes unconditionally.

The core message of Stoicism has been incorporated in many
modern new age "self help" books and material like the famous
and strongly recommended [The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle][71],
and it shares some values with Buddhism and other older philosophies.

By the way, many people have a strong sense that "self help" books
and materials are _hippie nonsense_ when in reality there are a lot
of valuable takes on how to improve oneself and deal with the hard stuff
in life, and a lot of them are modern takes of old teachings like
[The Bible][73], Buddhism, et al, and that many different takes have
greater probability of coming through the many different personalities
and stages in life that humans have. And of course there will be always
nonsense out there if you really look for it.

I strongly recommend [The Practicing Stoic by Farnsworth][70] if you
want a no nonsense practical introduction to Stoicism ready to be
applied to your day to day life. The audio book is specially good.

## Closing

I have tried many different things to improve my self
and be more resilient and resistant to whatever life throws at me,
stoicism, meditations and physical exercise are the best tools
I currently have available, I hope these little post serves as a
reference point to developers and people going through these same problems.
