<br/>I don't get Christmas
<br/>I do not get it at all,
<br/>is it religious?
<br/>or is it capitalistic?
<br/>I just don't fucking know.

<br/>And why are you so excited?
<br/>Is it the gatherings?
<br/>Is it the gifts?

<br/>And as I write this rant
<br/>I get a call
<br/>from my bro
<br/>he's happy
<br/>and alive
<br/>with his daughters
<br/>and his wife
<br/>down in Cordoba
<br/>and who am I
<br/>not to seize
<br/>the spoils of war?

<br/>Are we not here
<br/>to embrace each other
<br/>to laugh and cry
<br/>about the mysteries of life?

<br/>Perhaps I'm just an asshole
<br/>who didn't learn how to enjoy life
<br/>how to smile and be happy for once
<br/>that there are plenty of people around
<br/>that make it worth the while

A single life is not enough and you better enjoy this fucking ride.

While it lasts...
