<br/>People come and go,
<br/>from our life,
<br/>from everybody's life,
<br/>from a room,
<br/>from a club,
<br/>from their family,
<br/>from the limbo of conciousness.
<br/>
<br/>And we cannot attach
<br/>ourselves too much
<br/>to the fact that
<br/>they might not be here tomorrow.
<br/>
<br/>We weren't expecting them
<br/>in the first place.
<br/>They are random loot
<br/>by the creator,
<br/>or may be god,
<br/>and the only appropriate response
<br/>for their happenings,
<br/>is to be grateful that they did,
<br/>for every second with them
<br/>is a weird treasure,
<br/>cherished by humans
<br/>since the dawn of civilization.
<br/>
<br/>By the fire man sat,
<br/>by his and her loved ones,
<br/>knowing deep inside
<br/>that many things could end it all
<br/>in a single night.
<br/>
<br/>We shouldn't cry
<br/>about those who once were close
<br/>and now far apart,
<br/>as long as we stay true to our hearts
<br/>and seek the good of human kind
<br/>new loved ones will keep popping up
<br/>and more bounty will be stored
<br/>in our treasury department,
<br/>like king, army and castle,
<br/>all at once.
<br/>
<br/>It is at the breaking point of our lives,
<br/>that changes in the tides,
<br/>pages being turned by a hurricane,
<br/>that we go outside,
<br/>look god in the eyes
<br/>and scream as loud as we can:

_thank your for being alive by your side_

<br/>
